Django Dockerized App
This is a Dockerized Django application. Follow the steps below to get the project up and running.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't, you can follow the Docker installation guide for your operating system.
Steps to Start the Project
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

2. Build the Docker Image
Once you're inside the project directory, build the Docker image using the following command:
docker build -t mydjangoapp .
This will download the necessary base image, install the required dependencies, and set up the container.

3. Run the Docker Container
After the image is built, run the Django app inside a Docker container by using the following command:
docker run -p 8000:8000 mydjangoapp
This command will start the Django development server inside the container and map port 8000 on your local machine to port 8000 in the container.

4. Access the Application
Once the container is running, open your browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8000
You should see your Django application running.
